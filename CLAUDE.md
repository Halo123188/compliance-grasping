# Development Workflow

**Always use `uv run`, not python**.

```sh

# 1. Make changes.

# 2. Type check.
uv run ty check  # Fast
uv run pyright  # More thorough, but slower

# 3. Run tests.
uv run pytest tests/  # Single suite
uv run pytest tests/<test_file>.py  # Specific file

# 4. Format and lint before committing.
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
```

We've bundled common commands into a Makefile for convenience.

```sh
make format     # Format and lint
make type       # Type-check
make check      # make format && make type
make test-fast  # Run tests excluding slow ones
make test       # Run the full test suite
make docs       # Build documentation
```

Always run `make check` before committing. This runs formatting, linting,
and type checking. Do not commit code that fails type checking.

Before creating a PR, ensure all checks pass with `make test`.

When making user-facing changes, add an entry to `docs/source/changelog.rst`
under the "Upcoming version (not yet released)" section using
Added/Changed/Fixed categories. Reference issues with `:issue:\`123\``
(renders as a link to the GitHub issue).

# Rendered output

Every rendered clip and still goes under `videos/` in this repo. Nothing is
written to `/work/yiboc`, `/tmp` or a home directory: renders used to land in
four places at once, and 130 MB of clips ended up outside the repo on a
filesystem that is not backed up with it.

Scripts resolve their output through `scripts/tools/video_out.py`. A relative
path resolves against `videos/`, so `render_student.py R2-Small-SB` and
`render_student.py videos/R2-Small-SB` mean the same thing, and an absolute
path outside `videos/` still works but warns. Use it in any new render script
rather than building a path by hand.

`videos/` is gitignored, so nothing there is recoverable once deleted --
confirm before removing clips.

# Commits and PRs

- Put `Fixes #<number>` at the end of the commit message body, not in
  the title.
- PR body should be plain, concise prose. No section headers, checklists,
  or structured templates. Describe the problem, what the change does, and
  any non-obvious tradeoffs. A good PR description reads like a short
  paragraph to a colleague, not a form.
- PR and commit messages are rendered on GitHub, so don't hard-wrap them
  at 88 columns. Let each sentence flow on one line.

Some style guidelines to follow:
- Line length limit is 88 columns. This applies to code, comments, and docstrings.
- Avoid local imports unless they are strictly necessary (e.g. circular imports).
- Tests should follow these principles:
  - Use functions and fixtures; do not use test classes.
  - Favor targeted, efficient tests over exhaustive edge-case coverage.
  - Prefer running individual tests rather than the full test suite to improve iteration speed.
